<H3 text="ðŸŒ¿ The Beginning" />

<P text="It started with a dream â€” what if my monstera could learn when to ask for water?" />

<H3 text="ðŸ§  The Brain" />

<P text="I hooked up a Raspberry Pi, a soil moisture sensor, and a tiny neural network trained on 3 weeks of watering data." />

<P text="The plant now flashes a green LED when it's happy, and a red one when it's thirsty. Occasionally it plays 'lofi beats to grow to'." />

<H3 text="ðŸŒ± Results" />

<P text="After a month, I noticed the plant had grown faster. Was it the tech? Or just more attention? Either way, itâ€™s thriving." />

<H3 text="ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts" />

<P text="Merging tech with nature doesnâ€™t have to be dystopian. Sometimes it just means your plant blinks at you when it needs help." />
